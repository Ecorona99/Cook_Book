I am the submitter of this recipe and I would like to clarify a few things about it. Do not drain the excess liquid in the lentils!!!  It is supposed to be like a soup.  Also, make sure your tomatillo is ripe or it will be sour!  If you follow these directions the recipe should turn out how its supposed to.

This is an unusual and interesting dish.  I used almost every part of the recipe exactly except Cotija (it's difficult to find in some places), substituting it for Pepper Jack.  I also added another cup of water during the final cookdown process (I found the initial mix didn't have enough liquid for a stew consistency).

A few final thoughts: the tomatillos provide a sour note that may not sit well for some alongside the starchy lentils.  If that's the case, use half a tomatillo.  Also, on second trials of this recipe I used a can of tomatoes with green chiles instead of a roma.  This is a quick substitute.  Finally, I'd be interested to see if anyone is brave enough to substitute black beans for lentils.

I only gave this a 4 star because I made too many substitutions.  However, even with the substitutions it was a tasty soup.  Will try to make it according to directions next time.  Tip: if the soup is too spicy add a milk product.  I liked it better spicy but added cheese to kind of sort of follow the recipe. Great job, a different kind of soup!

Loved this recipe. I made it vegan style. Used Soyrizo and when I added the cumin, I also added extra onion powder and smoked paprika for some kick. Topped it with Vegan cheese — didn’t even need sour cream. Kids devoured it.

I think you did a wonderful job on this recipe.  The oil and fat from bacon and chorizo were a great addition.  I charred everything up and blended it as directed.  my wife is from Mexico and told me this reminded her of food her mom made for her.  thank you for a new and great addition to my cooking arsenal

A very tasty and versatile recipe.

I made a vegetarian version w/ soyrizo and veggie bacon. It turned out great!

From the first time I made this recipe, it became a huge hit in my home. At home, we prefer it with "Soy Chorizo", from Trader Joe's, over regular chorizo. Their seasoning really puts this dish over the top. Enjoy!

This was very delicious and probably the best lentil dish I have had!  Thank you for sharing. I did a couple changes. I could not find the cheese so I opted for freshly shredded pepper jack. I also subbed the tomatillo for small can of green chillis. I didnt want to serve as a soup so I made rice and served it  with white rice, the lentil mixture and poured some of the juice before garnishing with cheese and sour cream. It was amazing!

I drained the lentils and reduced the liquid. I had a little too much bacon grease, so I drained all but about two tablespoons .  I served it with a runny fried egg on top for breakfast. Delicious!!
More stewlike than probably intended, but worked great as a breakfast dish. 
Next time I'll try it according to the recipe. Definitely a keeper recipe.

Delicious. Used a small tomato from my garden and added a little extra cumin. Definitely will make it again.
